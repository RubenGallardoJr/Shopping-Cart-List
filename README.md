# Shopping-Cart-List
The given code is a React component called NavBar that takes in a list of menu items and a minimum stock value as props. It renders a list of the menu items that have at least the minimum stock value, and each item is displayed as a list item in the format "name:stock". If an item has less than the minimum stock value, it is removed from the list.

To use this component, you can pass in an array of menu items, where each item has a name and instock property. Additionally, you can specify the minimum stock value you want to display in the navbar by setting the minstock prop.

This code can be a useful starting point for building a dynamic navbar that only displays items with sufficient stock.
